Welcome to Mental Health Pool! We're here to support the Cardano community and help decentralize the world's trust systems. 

To that end, we created the Mental Health Pool to support the network AND donate to worthy mental health-focused 501(c)(3) organizations.

50% of profits (fees less operating costs) will be contributed to charities focused on mental health. We have deliberately designed our operating costs
to be as lean as possible while still acheiving world-class reliability and security. We run our node on Swiss-based servers to help diversify the geographic
footprint of the network, and given stronger Swiss privacy laws.

Our goal is to be as transparent as possible about our finances. We have therefore created the below Google sheet to track operating expenses, income, profits, and
charitable donations.

To the extent there is a mental health-focused charity you think is worthy of our donating to, please let us know! mentalhealthpool@pm.me
